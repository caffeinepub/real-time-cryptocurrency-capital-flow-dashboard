  "summary": "The diff does not show removal of CoinGecko-related frontend/runtime code or configuration; it only modifies backend/main.mo (adding/including user profile and many type definitions) and updates project_state.json metadata. As a result, the Binance-only rollback and complete CoinGecko removal requested in REQ-1/REQ-2 are not evidenced by these changes. The diff also appears to add unrelated backend functionality (user profile storage/access control).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Completely remove any CoinGecko dependency from the project and restore the application to the last stable Binance-only behavior (remove all CoinGecko code paths, config/env vars/constants, and UI behavior relying on CoinGecko; ensure no runtime calls to CoinGecko; keep user-facing text in English).",
      "reason": "The provided diff shows modifications only to backend/main.mo and project_state.json; there is no evidence of removing CoinGecko-related frontend services/hooks/utilities, deleting CoinGecko endpoint calls, or removing CoinGecko-related configuration variables. No frontend files are modified in this diff summary.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Publish the Binance-only rollback as the new stable baseline with CoinGecko fully removed (no optional switch to re-enable; builds without CoinGecko modules/imports/config).",
      "reason": "No evidence in the diff of deleting CoinGecko modules/imports/config or removing any feature flags/switches. Only backend/main.mo and project_state.json are modified, which does not demonstrate establishing Binance-only as the enforced baseline across the codebase.",

      "reason": "This backend feature is not requested by REQ-1/REQ-2 (which focus on removing CoinGecko and maintaining Binance-only market data behavior). The diff shows new public query/shared methods and profile storage unrelated to CoinGecko removal.",
